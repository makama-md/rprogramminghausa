# R programming in Hausa Language

We plan to run an R programming Study Jam from 5th June to July for 6 weeks in our local language of Hausa. Study Jams are a great opportunity to bring members of your community together to learn something new or advance their knowledge, with the help of a community facilitator. Skills learnt in this workshop can be used for personal development or career advancement.
